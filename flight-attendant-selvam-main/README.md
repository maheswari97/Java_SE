# Assignment 1 - Flight Attendant

You are working on an application that is responsible for managing flights data.

## Goals 

To complete this task you should implement methods in `FlightService` and `SeatService` (but not only here) and add/update code in other classes in this project as well (look for `//TODO implement` comments as hints). 

You can write JUnit 5 tests or create main class with `public static void main(String[] args) {}` method with some examples to demonstrate the functionality.

## System setup

Implement this project with plain Java only, there is no need to use additional libraries or any commonly used frameworks such as Spring or Hibernate, also no database connection or implementation of JDBC.

Use Java 11 and Maven 3.6.x and above (we tested it with Maven version 3.6.3).

## Implementation

Create a new feature branch (for example `assignment`) where you will make changes. 

You can create additional methods or classes if necessary to create reusable/readable code, but you should not alter existing method signatures ( their return type, throws clause etc ), or their visibility/structure.

## Submission and review

Commit and push your changes. Then please acknowledge us that your work is finished (by email or phone call) - after that, we will review your implementation.
